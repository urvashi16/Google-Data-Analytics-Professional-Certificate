#  About the Data Analytics Professional Certificate-
The Professional Certificate is made up of eight courses in total. One of which is a Capstone Project. Each course is arranged into four to five weeks, with graded weekly quizzes and a course quiz at the end. Just before the weekly quizzes, a glossary of the terms acquired over the week is provided to the learners. Let’s take a look at what each course enlightens us with and what I loved about them.

# 1) Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere!
This is a foundational course for those who want to learn the fundamentals of data. It provides an overview of the field of data analytics. Teaching how the Professional Certificate is broken down into sections and what we will study in each.

***The topics covered in this course are:***

```
The 5 essential skills of a Data Analyst.
The 5 key aspects of Analytical Thinking.
Lifecycle of Data.
The Steps/Phases of Data Analysis.
Tools a Data Analyst uses in a Data Ecosystem.
Lastly, job opportunities and best practices for job search.
Quick heads-up, the professional certificate is divided by the phases of the Data analysis process.
```

What I liked the most was Data Journal also known as Learning Logs, which encourages the learners to take notes and answer the questions according to their understanding.

# 2) Ask Questions to make Data-Driven Decisions
The very first Phase of the Data Analysis process, known as the “Ask Phase”, is what the course is based on.

***This course addressed the following topics:***

```
Asking effective Questions using SMART Methodology
Questions to avoid while asking
Types of Data
Data presentation tools and their use
Small Data vs. Big Data
Brief exposure to Spreadsheets
Types of Stakeholders and their roles in the project
How to work with the stakeholders and tips for Communication
```

My favourite part about this course was how a data analyst should make a Scope of Work for the project they are working on. It helps in keeping track of the workflow of the project. The SOW consists of Deliverables, Milestones, Timeline, and Reports in order for the project to meet its deadlines and goals through excellent planning and coordination by the team members.

# 3) Prepare Data for Explorations
“Prepare Phase”, the second step of the Data Analysis process. Tells how one needs to prepare the data before starting with the Data Analytics project.

***It teaches about:***

```
How data is collected.
Considerations for Data Collection
The different Formats of Data
Data types and how to identify good Data
Bias and it’s types
Aspects of Data Ethics
Data Privacy and Data Security
Lastly, some SQL Basics
Getting started with Linkedin and Kaggle.
```
The part that excited me the most in this course was it’s introduction to Kaggle and how one can get started. I had only used Kaggle to check Notebooks and competitions up until now, but this prompted me to sign up.

# 4) Process Data from Dirty to Clean
Moving on to the very next step of the Data Analysis process, the “Process Phase”. This 6-week long course focused more on Data Cleaning processes. Technically it’s a 5-week course as the 6th week is just a course challenge.

***Topics discussed in this course were:***

```
Statistical measures associated with data integrity including statistical power, hypothesis testing, and margin of error
Data integrity with reference to types and risks
Data Cleaning techniques
Cleaning Data in Spreadsheets and SQL
Documenting Data Cleaning process
Elements of a Data Analyst resume
```
Data Integrity was one fascinating topic in this course. It is the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of Data throughout it’s lifecycle. To ensure Data Integrity, Data cleaning comes into the picture.

# 5) Analyze Data to Answer Questions
Analysis, is what the course is based on. The process that is used to make sense of the data collected. The “Analyze Phase” of the Data Analysis process is discussed here.

***Topics covered were:***

```
Data Analysis Basics
Organizing Data for analyzing
Sorting Data in Spreadsheet and SQL
Converting and Formatting Data
Combining multiple Datasets
Data aggregation using VLOOKUP and JOINS
Pivot Tables and Data Validation process.
```
I enjoyed learning the JOIN clause in SQL as it was one of the things that I always struggled with, and the videos were extremely helpful in making me understand it.

Although this course explains how to analyze data in both SQL and Spreadsheets, it was sometimes confusing to grasp the functions as the videos were mixed up.

# 6) Share Data through the Art of Visualization
This course was the most intriguing section of the Professional Certificate. The “Share Phase” of the Data Analysis process was taught here. It demonstrates how to get started with Tableau, a data visualization tool.

***Went through the following topics:***

```
Communicating Data insights
Frameworks for organizing Visualizations
Principles of Design
Phases of Design Thinking
Data Storytelling
The Art and Science of Effective Presentation
```
I enjoyed every minute of this course because it introduced me to Tableau and provided excellent presentation tips. Another notion that I liked was Data Storytelling, which teaches people how to make their stories more engaging to their audience.

# 7) Data Analysis with R Programming
The professional certificate’s last course teaches how to run codes in Rstudio using the R programming language. It also covers the “Act Phase” of the Data Analysis Process in the end.

***The course covers the following topics:***

```
Basic programming concepts
Exploring R packages
Cleaning Data in R
Creating Data Visualizations in R
Developing Documentations and Reports in R
```
In this course we learned how to clean, process, manipulate, visualize, and document using the R programming language. It was a combination of all the previous courses.

The hands-on activities were the most beneficial, as they allowed me to practice using Rstudio. Although getting started with Rstudio was a little difficult at first, practice made it easier.

# 8) Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study
The Final course of the professional certificate, which is a capstone project. It isn’t necessary to complete it, however, it is required in order to obtain the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

There are two tracks on the course. The learners must select one of the tracks and apply their knowledge to clean, process, manipulate and analyze the data. Lastly, they had to present their insights and recommend the right steps to take for solving the case study.

***Track 1-***

```
Case Study 1: Cyclistic Bike-Share
Case Study 2: Bellabeat smart devices
```
***Track 2-***

```
Here the learners need to choose their own case study and give valuable insights.
The learners were also instructed on how to build a portfolio and what resources they could use to do so.

# Conclusion
The article has now come to an end. The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, in my opinion, is perfect for anyone interested in getting started with data analysis. The coursework is well-presented, and it equips students with the necessary fundamental knowledge of Data Analysis.
